# dailytracker

As a new mother going back to work
I want to keep track of each day and how good it was
So that I can I look back on a week, month or year and see if it really was bad or good

Given that I am using a computer
When I click on a date
The day should turn green, then yellow, then red, then white

When a day is a certain color
Then I should see it counted and see the percentage of days clicked are the color
